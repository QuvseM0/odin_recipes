Hello and welcome,
My name is Afonso (quvse) and i'm following my The Odin Project's first project, creating a webpage for linking recipes and committing it to github.
I hope that by the end of this project i will be able to demonstrate my skills using all that i've learned so far:
    .Use the linux operating system to do all my work
    .Use my skills with the CLI to navigate the OS
    .Use my knowledge of HTML to create a webpage 
    .Use my knowledge of git and github to commit my project

Fingers crossed!
